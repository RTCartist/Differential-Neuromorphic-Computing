For the tactile processing, the Verilog codes and the configuration files are provided, which can perform the functions including:
1. Acquisition of external pressure information
2. Reading of the memristor state 
3. Selection of the adaptive modulation
4. External communication protocols
Additionally, equivalent simulation files are provided, preserving the fundamental concepts of differential neuromorphic computing. This involves selecting an adaptive memristive modulation scheme tailored to the sensory features.

Required software and version:
1. Quartus
2. Python

Dependencies:
Python(numpy, matplotlib, scipy, random, time)

Configuration instruction:
1. Download the required software from the official website.

The code using steps:
1. For hardware implementation, Verilog codes are located in the 'Hardware/MEM_frame' folder and the mem_frame_1ch.v within the 'Hardware/MEM_frame/rtl' folder is the top-level file. You could run the project mem_frame_1ch.qpf in Quartus in the 'Hardware/MEM_frame/par' folder directly. Configuration files reside in the 'Hardware/Configuration' folder, providing the pin configuration used in the design. These Verilog codes can be customized to meet specific usage requirements and circuit designs.
2. For the equivalent simulation, the simulation file located in the 'Simulation' folder includes the establishment of the memristor model, the input sensory set, the selection of dynamic modulation schemes, and the readout of results.
