# STM32 RS485 Robot Control Example
This repository contains example code for controlling robots using RS485 communication.

# Directory Structure
core/: Contains hardware-specific source and header files for various STM32 chips.
driver/: Holds software-related driver files mainly for interrupt handling and timers.
MDK-ARM/: Includes Keil project files for the setup.
RS485.ioc: Configuration file for the STM32 environment.
# Purpose
The code provided in this repository is designed to demonstrate how to control robots using RS485 communication protocols with STM32 microcontrollers.

# How to Run
Follow these steps to compile and run the project on an STM32F407 device using the Keil development environment.

## Prerequisites
The Keil environment is configured for the STM32F407, with the appropriate hardware packages installed.
## Compilation and Deployment
1. Open Project: Start the Keil environment and open the RS485.uvprojx file in MDK_ARM folder.
2. Compile: Compile all necessary files.
3. Build: Complete the build process to generate the executable.
4. Download: Download the compiled program to your hardware device.
5. Hardware Reset: Perform a hardware reset to initiate the program.
